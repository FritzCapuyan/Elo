A small package to calculate Elo scores for arbitrary paired comparisons. If Params is supplied to elo(), then it will use those params. Otherwise elo() will attempt to maximize the log likelihood with respect to K factors (the maximum change in elo from a win or loss). Note that the K factors are chosen based on the number of competitions that an individual participates in, and without params supplied, is hardcoded.
